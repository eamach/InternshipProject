# Internship project which aims to bring Security Automation into the context of pipelines

Consists in a series of Docker containers that'll run security analysis and a helper project called "Gitlab Report Parser" that analyses the different reports and produces a human readable output.

Planned improvements were: a centralized issue database with insights on the different projects using this toolset, Dynamic Application Security Testing and Regression testing.

Parts of the codebase were modified in order to remove sensitive data.
**This project has since been discontinued.**
